# prettylogger
The purpose of this repository is learning and enjoying object-oriented design and implementation, and the subject for it is 
logging.

So I'm going to design and implement a logging framework and some useful implementation.

Because of the preceding purpose, I don't stick to making this library practicable.

I'm not very experienced so any ideas are welcome.
